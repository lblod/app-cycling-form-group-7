This directory contains some utility queries

# anonymize

this anonimizes PII data in a database. Be sure to replace the salts in the queries.

# reduce

this reduces the size of a large database to only a couple of bestuurseenheden to have a realistic but small dataset.

# nb-members

There are a few queries in the migration folder local that set the number of members of specific mandates. This is based on a csv file that is converted to a turtle file (see scripts for these) which is then parsed. After parsing it can be useful to check which csv-rows were unsuccessful. The query `check-unsuccessful-aantal-leden.sparql` checks this.
